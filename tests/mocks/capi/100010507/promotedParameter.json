Rising Social Security and health costs already are projected to carve a bigger hole in the federal budget, pushing the deficit to an unacceptable level.</p><p>One suggestion she has to accelerate growth and address declining productivity is immigration. Her remarks took direct aim at a priority of the Trump administration to curtail the inflow of foreigners, particularly from countries with large Muslim populations.</p><p>\"Policies that increase the growth and productivity of the workforce would address not only fiscal imbalances but the downward pressure on longer-run growth from demographics or other sources,\" she said. \"Policies that increase immigration, not reduce it, that support continuing education, that encourage R&amp;D and innovation, and that provide incentives so people work longer should receive attention.\"</p><p>Mester is one of the more hawkish members of <asset_inline nid=\"43752521\">the Fed</asset_inline>, pushing harder for rate hikes at a central bank that has been slow to come off the cheap-money policies implemented since the fiscal crisis.</p><p>However, she pointed out that policymakers recently acknowledged that <asset_inline nid=\"104732681\">they overestimated what the long-term \"neutral\" rate would be</asset_inline>, or the level that is neither overly stimulative nor restrictive to growth.</p><p>In fact, she conceded that if Congress doesn't take more action to control benefit costs, the days of zero interest rates and money-printing will return.</p><p>\"In a world where counter-cyclical fiscal policy is constrained, business cycle volatility could rise, and monetary policy could find itself near the zero lower bound more often, potentially requiring the use of nontraditional policy tools such as asset purchases and forward guidance in order to meet monetary policymakers' economic objectives,\" she said.</p><p>In addition to the low rates, the Fed ballooned its <asset_inline nid=\"104388998\">balance sheet to $4.5 trillion</asset_inline> through the purchase of government debt and mortgage-backed securities, in an effort to drive down lending rates and boost asset prices like stocks and corporate bonds.</p><p>The Fed has long sought help from fiscal policy to complement its monetary moves.</p><p>\"If financing the funding shortfall through increased government borrowing is undesirable, raising taxes and reducing benefits or other expenditures are not very appealing either,\" Mester said. \"Depending on how such policies are implemented, they could ultimately hurt the economy's longer-run growth prospects, leaving the fiscal outlook even worse.\"</p><p>Mester will be a voting member of the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee next year, when the central bank also gets new members to fill the three vacancies on the board of governors.</p><p><strong>WATCH: How the Republican tax reform bill could affect the Fed</strong>.</p></div></group></body>",

Stocks have remained anchored in better growth prospects,\" he added, with every one of the top 45 largest world economies — including the U.S. — recording positive growth in 2017, according to&#160;the OECD.&#160;</p><p>More of the same is said to be on tap for 2018. \"That is a fantastic environment for investors,\" Kleintop said.</p><p><strong>More from the IMPACT Conference:</strong><br /> <asset_inline nid=\"104844916\">The 12 end-of-life-documents you need</asset_inline><br /> <asset_inline nid=\"104844190\">The wall of worry advisors are facing</asset_inline><br /> <asset_inline nid=\"104051502\">Advisors fighting elder financial abuse</asset_inline></p><p>The current pace of growth, the best and broadest in 10 years, \"is lifting earnings, with little sign [and] little risk of recession or a bear market or bubble-bursting in the next 12 months,\" Kleintop said, also noting that the yield curve — the difference between short- and long-term interest rates and, historically, a good predictor of a coming recession — seems to indicate the all-clear for at least another two to three years.</p><p>Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist and senior vice president at Schwab, agreed. The yield curve, she said, indicates \"very minimal lift at this stage in the risk of recession, and I think we really probably don't have to really worry about that until about 2019 or so.\"</p><p>Good news for sure, but optimism can eventually morph into investor euphoria. And Sonders reminded attendees that&#160;the American-born British investor and fund manager Sir John Templeton once famously quipped that, in the end, bull markets die on euphoria.</p><p>\"We all know this has been a unique bull market, so I have my own take on this: That this bull market was born on despair, grew on disbelief, has matured on skepticism and may die on acceptance,\" Sonders said, referring to the somewhat tempered (historically speaking) optimism typical of today's investor.</p></div></group></body>",

So far, they're among its strongest early supporters anyway.</p><p>But their personal loyalty to Trump and his party faces a big test from <asset_inline nid=\"104844820\">the tax cut debate</asset_inline> — and spending cut debate soon to follow.</p><p>The House bill Republicans hope to pass Thursday, tax analysts for Congress say, will reduce effective tax rates twice as much for those earning $1 million or more as for those earning $100,000 or less. <asset_inline nid=\"104844030\">The Senate bill makes big tax cuts for corporations permanent</asset_inline> but makes smaller ones for moderate-income families only temporary.</p><p>Those specifics contradict what Trump's base — heavily weighted toward older whites without college educations — has said it wants from Washington. In an in-depth study of voter attitudes after the 2016 election, his core supporters expressed disdain for Wall Street and advocated higher, not lower, taxes on the wealthy.</p><p>On the eve of 2018 elections, Democrats have begun a high-volume effort to highlight that contradiction in priorities. Even if they can't stop the tax bill, the stated plans of congressional Republicans and the Trump White House will give them fresh material.</p><p>\"One thing we're going to be looking at very strongly is welfare reform,\" Trump told his Cabinet last month. \"People are taking advantage of the system.\"</p><p>But this may diverge from racially charged welfare debates of the past, fueled by blue-collar whites resentful that their tax dollars financed benefit rolls containing disproportionate numbers of African-Americans. This time, benefits at risk include those largely benefitting blue-collar whites themselves.</p><p>One big target is Medicaid, which provides health care to low-income Americans. Republicans have sought to cut it by hundreds of billions of dollars in their proposals to repeal and replace Obamacare.</p><p>Low-income whites represent a majority of nonelderly Medicaid beneficiaries in numerous states Trump carried such as Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan, West Virginia, Kentucky and Arkansas. They also represent a majority of elderly Medicaid beneficiaries receiving nursing home care financed by the federal government.</p><p>Trump has pledged not to cut Social Security benefits. But his budget director, <asset_inline nid=\"104507035\">Mick Mulvaney</asset_inline>, persuaded him to seek reductions in Social Security disability benefits by arguing, as he explained to Politico, that \"<asset_inline ext_link=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/09/01/mick-mulvaney-omb-trump-budget-profile-feature-215546\" ext_title=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/09/01/mick-mulvaney-omb-trump-budget-profile-feature-215546\">It's welfare</asset_inline>.\"</p><p>In fact, policy experts in both parties see the disability program as swollen and ripe for reform. They say disability has become a damaging trap for millions with medical problems who still could work — but are forbidden from doing so once they qualify for its benefits.</p><p>Reductions will hit home with core Trump supporters in any case. Seven in 10 Social Security disability recipients are white, many of them aging, blue-collar workers displaced from good-paying jobs by competition from imports and other shifts in the global economy.</p><p>\"It affects the white working-class guys as they get older,\" said Jason Turner, a conservative welfare expert. \"That's the impetus for a lot of them asking for disability.\"</p><p>Trump has also pledged not to touch Medicare benefits. But <asset_inline nid=\"104398705\">Mulvaney told me earlier this year</asset_inline> the administration would \"talk about it\" if congressional Republicans pass longstanding proposals to cut spending by converting Medicare to a \"premium support\" program for private insurance.</p><p>House Speaker <asset_inline nid=\"10000488\">Paul Ryan</asset_inline> has been a principal advocate of that idea, as well as for curbing Social Security as baby boom retirements expand benefit rolls. Despite Trump's pledges, the speaker hasn't given up.</p><p>Indeed, the higher deficits that analysts forecast from the GOP tax proposals will only increase pressure to curb benefits.</p><p>\"There's two things you have to do to get our fiscal house in order,\" Ryan told reporters last week. \"Grow the economy, get people working and paying taxes, and deal with spending — especially entitlement spending.\"</p><p>\"We've got a lot more work to do on that front,\" he concluded.</p><p>Seven in 10 Americans age 65 or older are white. One-third of them rely on Social Security to lift them out of poverty, according to Census data.</p></div></group></body>",
