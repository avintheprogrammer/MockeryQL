So far, they're among its strongest early supporters anyway.</p><p>But their personal loyalty to Trump and his party faces a big test from <asset_inline nid=\"104844820\">the tax cut debate</asset_inline> — and spending cut debate soon to follow.</p><p>The House bill Republicans hope to pass Thursday, tax analysts for Congress say, will reduce effective tax rates twice as much for those earning $1 million or more as for those earning $100,000 or less. <asset_inline nid=\"104844030\">The Senate bill makes big tax cuts for corporations permanent</asset_inline>&#160;but makes smaller ones for moderate-income families only temporary.</p><p>Those specifics contradict what Trump's base&#160;— heavily weighted toward older whites without college educations&#160;— has said it wants from Washington. In an in-depth study of voter attitudes after the 2016 election, his core supporters expressed disdain for Wall Street and advocated higher, not lower, taxes on the wealthy.</p><p>On the eve of 2018 elections, Democrats have begun a high-volume effort to highlight that contradiction in priorities. Even if they can't stop the tax bill, the stated plans of congressional Republicans and the Trump White House will give them fresh material.</p><p>\"One thing we're going to be looking at very strongly is welfare reform,\" Trump told his Cabinet last month. \"People are taking advantage of the system.\"</p><p>But this may diverge from racially charged welfare debates of the past, fueled by blue-collar whites resentful that their tax dollars financed benefit rolls containing disproportionate numbers of African-Americans. This time, benefits at risk include those largely benefitting blue-collar whites themselves.</p><p>One big target is Medicaid, which provides health care to low-income Americans. Republicans have sought to cut it by hundreds of billions of dollars in their proposals to repeal and replace Obamacare.</p><p>Low-income whites represent a majority of nonelderly Medicaid beneficiaries in numerous states Trump carried such as Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan, West Virginia, Kentucky and Arkansas. They also represent a majority of elderly Medicaid beneficiaries receiving nursing home care financed by the federal government.</p><p>Trump has pledged not to cut Social Security benefits. But his budget director, <asset_inline nid=\"104507035\">Mick Mulvaney</asset_inline>, persuaded him to seek reductions in Social Security disability benefits by arguing, as he explained to Politico, that \"<asset_inline ext_link=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/09/01/mick-mulvaney-omb-trump-budget-profile-feature-215546\" ext_title=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/09/01/mick-mulvaney-omb-trump-budget-profile-feature-215546\">It's welfare</asset_inline>.\"</p><p>In fact, policy experts in both parties see the disability program as swollen and ripe for reform. They say disability has become a damaging trap for millions with medical problems who still could work&#160;— but are forbidden from doing so once they qualify for its benefits.</p><p>Reductions will hit home with core Trump supporters in any case. Seven in 10 Social Security disability recipients are white, many of them aging, blue-collar workers displaced from good-paying jobs by competition from imports and other shifts in the global economy.</p><p>\"It affects the white working-class guys as they get older,\" said Jason Turner, a conservative welfare expert. \"That's the impetus for a lot of them asking for disability.\"</p><p>Trump has also pledged not to touch Medicare benefits. But <asset_inline nid=\"104398705\">Mulvaney told me earlier this year</asset_inline> the administration would \"talk about it\" if congressional Republicans pass longstanding proposals to cut spending by converting Medicare to a \"premium support\" program for private insurance.</p><p>House Speaker <asset_inline nid=\"10000488\">Paul Ryan</asset_inline> has been a principal advocate of that idea, as well as for curbing Social Security as baby boom retirements expand benefit rolls. Despite Trump's pledges, the speaker hasn't given up.</p><p>Indeed, the higher deficits that analysts forecast from the GOP tax proposals will only increase pressure to curb benefits.</p><p>\"There's two things you have to do to get our fiscal house in order,\" Ryan told reporters last week. \"Grow the economy, get people working and paying taxes, and deal with spending&#160;— especially entitlement spending.\"</p><p>\"We've got a lot more work to do on that front,\" he concluded.</p><p>Seven in 10 Americans age 65 or older are white. One-third of them rely on Social Security to lift them out of poverty, according to Census data.</p></div></group></body>",

Entering college in 1979, the dark days of Jimmy Carter left us with high inflation, high interest rates, high unemployment and low job creation. Worse yet, instead of investing in new ideas, capital went into ways to shield income from ridiculously high taxes.</p><p>Though the economy is in better shape today, students of the market know that tax reform is an absolute must if the market rally is to continue. There are three critical components we must focus on: Time, momentum and value.</p><p>We're running out of <strong>time</strong>. It's unfortunate that the Republican controlled congress did not act on tax reform before trying to tackle Obamacare repeal. The distractions have left little time for republican leadership to create a package acceptable to its own members, let alone others from across the aisle.</p><p>The latest attempt by the Senate to include repeal of the Affordable Care Act in the tax reform bill has left legislative print in jeopardy. What was supposed to be the first real reform in 30 years is in the process of being watered down, and even worse, the end product could be unpassable. ACA repeal must be separated from the reform package or it could fail. Repealing the ACA is a distraction, period.</p></div></group></body>",

That's a slower pace than&#160;<asset_inline nid=\"104648367\">in the prior period</asset_inline>&#160;when digital sales were up 60 percent.</p><p>Wal-Mart also raised its full-year earnings expectations,&#160;taking an aggressive stance heading into the important holiday season.</p><p>Here's what Wal-Mart reported, compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a Thomson Reuters survey of analysts:</p><ul>\n<li>Earnings of $1 a share, excluding items, compared with a forecast profit of 97 cents per share.</li>\n<li>Revenue was $123.18 billion, versus an estimate of $121 billion.</li>\n<li>Same-store sales for U.S. stores, excluding fuel, climbed 2.7 percent, compared with an anticipated increase of 1.8 percent.</li>\n</ul><p>\"We have momentum, and it's encouraging to see customers responding to our store and eCommerce initiatives,\" CEO Doug McMillon said in a statement.</p><p>\"Existing customers have become advocates for popular initiatives like online grocery and free two-day shipping, and as a result, new customers, suppliers and partnerships are coming to Walmart.\"</p><p>In the third quarter, Wal-Mart reported net income of $1.75 billion, or 58 cents a share, which included a $283 million charge to account for a likely fine related to&#160;a Foreign Corrupt Practices Act violation investigation that has been ongoing since 2012. Excluding that charge and other one-time costs, Wal-Mart earned $1 a share, outpacing Wall Street estimates.</p><p>A year ago, Wal-Mart posted net income of $3.02 billion, or 98 cents a share.</p><p>Total revenue for the third quarter climbed 4.2 percent, to $123.18 billion from $118.18 billion. This included sales growth of 4.3 percent for Wal-Mart's U.S. business, 4.1 percent growth for Wal-Mart's international stores and 4.4 percent growth at Sam's Club.</p><p>The average ticket at Wal-Mart's U.S. stores was up 1.2 percent, helped by the rapid growth of its food business. Wal-Mart said its&#160;grocery categories delivered the strongest quarterly comparable sales performance in&#160;nearly&#160;six years, with fresh meat, bakery and produce leading the&#160;way.</p><p>\"Market share in the critical food category continues to grow as the expansion of its buy-online/pick-up in store capability is driving increased sales, and the focus on improving working capital continues,\" Moody's retail analyst Charlie O'Shea wrote in a note to clients.</p><p>\"As usual, we expect Walmart to largely set the tone on multiple fronts and in multiple categories for the Holiday season.\"</p><p>Comparable sales at U.S. stores, excluding fuel, were up 2.7 percent, versus a 1.2 percent increase a year ago, also outpacing analysts' estimates. Wal-Mart said hurricane-related impacts benefited comparable sales by roughly 30 to 50 basis points. And with fuel, total U.S. comparable sales were up 3 percent, versus a 1.1 percent increase a year ago.</p><p>Same-store sales at Sam's Club, excluding fuel, climbed 2.8 percent in the fiscal third quarter, compared with an increase of 1.4 percent one year ago. With fuel, Sam's Club's comparable sales grew 4 percent, versus 0.7 percent growth a year ago.</p><p>Looking to the full year, Wal-Mart is now calling for adjusted earnings per share ranging from $4.38 to $4.46 in fiscal 2018. It previously expected earning $4.30 to $4.40 a share, while analysts had forecast a per-share profit of $4.38.</p><p>\"We expect top line growth going forward to be led more by comp sales and eCommerce with less emphasis on new units in the U.S.,\" Chief Financial Officer&#160;Brett Biggs said on a prerecorded conference call.</p><p>\"We're prioritizing eCommerce, technology, supply chain and store remodels over new stores and clubs.\"</p><p>Wal-Mart's latest results show the company is holding its own in a competitive field, which includes rival <asset_inline nid=\"1514583\">Target</asset_inline>. On Wednesday, <asset_inline nid=\"104835074\">Target issue a more conservative outlook for the holidays</asset_inline>, sending its shares tumbling.</p><p>Meantime, all&#160;signs point to Wal-Mart&#160;being in a retail&#160;war with internet giant&#160;<asset_inline nid=\"1502862\">Amazon</asset_inline>.</p><p>After acquiring Jet.com,&#160;the big-box retailer's&#160;online sales have skyrocketed, as Wal-Mart brought other brands including Bonobos, Modcloth and Moosejaw into its portfolio. The company is also expanding curbside grocery pick-up service, beefing up its digital assortment and working with Amazon-rival&#160;<asset_inline nid=\"1501792\">Google</asset_inline> on voice-activated shopping.</p><p>One weakness for Wal-Mart has been that <asset_inline nid=\"104648367\">its profit margins&#160;have dipped&#160;slightly</asset_inline>&#160;due to more aggressive promotions. The retailer has been investing heavily to keep its prices competitive, and operating margins fell to 3.9 percent during the fiscal third quarter, from 4.4 percent a year ago.</p><p>\"Price investments in certain markets and the mix effects of our growing eCommerce business were the primary contributors to the decline, although the impact from hurricanes in the U.S. was a significant contributor as well,\" Biggs said.</p><p>Heading into the holidays, Wal-Mart plans to invest more in its stores — holding seasonal parties for customers — and offer more merchandise online. Just this week, <asset_inline nid=\"104839606\">the company announced</asset_inline> a partnership with Lord &amp; Taylor in which Walmart.com will begin selling the department store chain's high-end apparel next spring.</p><p>McMillon said Thursday the company is focused on attracting more \"premium brands,\" such as KitchenAid and Bose, to&#160;the company's&#160;website.</p><p>Including Thursday's gains, Wal-Mart&#160;shares have&#160;climbed&#160;more than&#160;40 percent in 2017.</p></div></group></body>",

But it's at least agreeing to consider applications it had previously rejected out of hand.</p><p>That could mean another two years of protection from deportation for hundreds, maybe even thousands, of immigrants. And it marks the first major reversal on immigration policy from an administration that has generally taken pride in its hardline stance.</p><p>The announcement, made <asset_inline ext_link=\"https://www.uscis.gov/news/alerts/uscis-guidance-daca-renewal-requests-affected-mail-service-issues\" ext_title=\"\"> late Wednesday night</asset_inline> by the Department of Homeland Security and <asset_inline ext_link=\"https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/11/15/nyregion/uscis-immigration-daca-requests.html?smid=tw-share&amp;referer=https://t.co/JUXrE1CjPx?amp=1\" ext_title=\"\"> first reported by the New York Times</asset_inline>, affects two different groups of immigrants whose DACA renewal applications were originally rejected. And it gives each group a different path to resubmitting the application. The Trump administration is taking a more generous attitude toward immigrants whose DACA renewal applications were sitting in U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services mailboxes as of Oct. 5, but were marked late because they weren't picked up by a courier service until Oct. 6.</p><p>As <asset_inline ext_link=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/11/15/16650400/daca-renewal-deadline-rejected-lockbox-uscis\" ext_title=\"\"> Vox first reported Wednesday morning</asset_inline>, this happened in at least two of the three USCIS mailboxes, and could have affected hundreds of applications. \"USCIS will proactively reach out to those DACA requestors,\" the administration's new guidance says, \"to inform them that they may resubmit their DACA request.\"</p><p>It's not clear exactly how that notification is going to happen, or how much time USCIS will give immigrants to resubmit their applications.</p><p>The second group of DACA recipients affected by the new announcement are immigrants whose applications arrived in USCIS mailboxes on Oct. 6 or later, but were sent well in advance of the deadline. As the <asset_inline ext_link=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/nyregion/post-office-mail-delays-daca-applications.html?_r=0\" ext_title=\"\"> New York Times first reported</asset_inline> last week, some applications were stuck in a weeks-long mysterious Postal Service slowdown.</p><p>The scope of the slowdown is still unknown, but <asset_inline ext_link=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/11/15/16650400/daca-renewal-deadline-rejected-lockbox-uscis\" ext_title=\"\"> Vox reported Wednesday</asset_inline> that it affected immigrants in more states than were originally reported — and that it affected applications sent as early as Sept. 11.</p><p>Immigrants whose applications arrived late due to the mail slowdown will <em>not</em> be contacted by the government to reapply. They'll have to show the government \"individualized proof that the request was originally mailed in a timely manner,\" and that the reason it arrived late was because of the Postal Service. (It's not yet clear exactly what proof the government will accept; immigrants who sent their applications by certified mail, and therefore were able to track their packages through the system, will have more evidence available than others.)</p><p>DHS's reversal probably doesn't cover all the applications that were received late. But it's probable that it covers a substantial portion of them.</p><p>And even if not all of the immigrants who are eligible end up reapplying, or if all resubmitted applications are ultimately approved, it's all but certain that the reversal will result in some immigrants getting two more years of protections instead of losing them imminently.</p><p>The Trump administration didn't have to do this.</p><p>When DHS was first told about the Postal Service slowdown, and when it was first told about the cases where applications in the mailbox on Oct. 5 had been rejected, it refused to reconsider the applications.</p><p>There isn't any law or policy that forces the government to reconsider applications that are rejected for reasons outside the applicant's control. USCIS has discretion in cases like this.</p><p>It's just that generally, the government <em>does</em> use that discretion to accept applications that arrive at the office a day late because they've been sitting in the mailbox overnight.</p><p>And from the perspective of immigration advocates, the Postal Service slowdown wasn't that different from Hurricane Maria — both caused applications to arrive late through no fault of the immigrants' own — but the government accepted late applications affected by Maria, and not those affected by the slowdown.</p><p>Except that now, it will.</p><p>This is extremely unusual. The government doesn't usually reject a bunch of applications and then change its mind and allow people to reapply. And the Trump administration, in particular, doesn't usually reverse its position in order to give unauthorized immigrants a pass.</p><p>In its first 10 months, the Trump administration's policy impact has been felt more on immigration than on any other issue. And in nearly every case, the administration has taken the most restrictive possible approach: granting relief to immigrants (legal and unauthorized) only where it has no choice but to do so.</p><p>Indeed, administration officials all but brag about the change in approach. They see it as a restoration of the \"rule of law.\" And they don't generally buckle in the face of public criticism.</p><p>But this time, something appears to have led them to change their minds, and give immigrants one more chance.</p><p>This reversal could affect the progressive effort to sue the administration into keeping the DACA program. Some of those lawsuits — such as the one filed in New York that first revealed the overnight mailbox problem — hinge on the idea that the administration is shutting down the program in a capricious manner. It's possible that this second-thought generosity will make it easier for the feds to argue they aren't being capricious; it's also possible, on the other hand, that they'll have more trouble claiming that DACA shutdown was a well-thought-through and deliberate process.</p><p>Legislatively, it's possible that some members of Congress will feel less urgency in passing a bill to address the status of DACA recipients as quickly as possible. But even though fewer people are likely to lose their protections in the coming weeks and months because of DHS's reversal, thousands still will.</p><p>At least 18,000 immigrants are going to lose their DACA protections because they didn't apply for renewal in time at all (possibly because they didn't know about the Oct. 5 deadline, which was announced only a month in advance, and which immigrants weren't informed by the government about). At least some of the 4,000 late applications probably aren't eligible to be reconsidered. And, of course, it's not at all clear how stingy USCIS will be in actually approving DACA renewal applications on the merits.</p><p><asset_inline nid=\"10000329\">President Donald Trump</asset_inline> has said nothing will happen to DACA recipients for six months, but his administration has guaranteed that thousands of them will lose protections before March 5. That's still true, even after the reversal on late applications. But now, the administration is taking a less aggressive stance toward stripping DACA recipients of the protections they currently have. And it's no longer using \"the rule of law\" to penalize immigrants who, when applying for one last DACA renewal, did all the right things.</p></div></group></body>",

Some consumer goods companies have bought innovation by acquiring small, on-trend brands.</p><p>When asked specifically about whether Coke would buy energy drink company <asset_inline nid=\"1520691\">Monster</asset_inline>, which it already has a 16.7 percent stake in, Quincey declined to comment on speculation. However, he said the beverage company will continue to make bolt-on acquisitions.</p><p>\"Whether it's a bolt-on or it's anything transformational, it's always got to obey three criteria: there's a strategic fit, there's a logic strategically, and the numbers financially add up, and there's opportunity,\" he said. \"It takes two to tango.\"</p><p>Another issue confronting Coke is soda taxes, which have been popping up in more jurisdictions to raise revenue and push consumers to healthier drinks.&#160;</p><p>Soda taxes aren't an \"existential\" crisis to Coke, Quincey said, though he shared his doubt on their effect on solving the obesity crisis. As to what Coke can do, he said that includes its formulations, packages and information it shares on products.</p><p>\"When we can take action, we absolutely have the responsibility to do so, but we believe that solving the obesity crisis, which does need to be solved, will require a much broader response from private companies and the government rather than thinking a narrow tax is going to solve it,\" he said.&#160;</p><p>Coke's new Zero Sugar offering is growing, Quincey said. The drink was introduced in the U.S. in August to replace Coke Zero after proving successful overseas. The introduction helped boost the <asset_inline nid=\"104793850\">company's performance last quarter</asset_inline>.&#160;</p><p>Coke&#160;reaffirmed its full-year guidance ahead of Thursday's&#160;investor day, the company's first in eight years. Quincey took over in May after serving as Coke's chief operating officer.&#160;</p><p>Shares of Coke have gained 13 percent this year, a rare story in the consumer goods industry that has been hammered amid changing shopping and eating habits. They were up 0.3 percent on Thursday.&#160;</p><p><em>—CNBC's Sara Eisen contributed to this reporting.&#160;</em></p></div></group></body>",
