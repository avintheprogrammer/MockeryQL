Here's why:<br /> <br />• Shares of Target fell nearly 10 percent in Wednesday trading after it reported earnings, due in large part to what&#160;it believes could be a soft holiday season. If Wal-Mart and Best Buy reports reflect similarly dim forecasts, Schlossberg said, he would grow worried about what the fourth quarter holds.<br /> <br />• \"Given the fact that so much of retail has now moved to online, it's almost a slam dunk to think that Amazon is going to be the primary beneficiary of whatever Christmas demand we're going to see this year. The big question is whether the brick-and-mortar stores are going to be able to stave off some of that customer demand and capture some of the additional dollars,\" he said Wednesday on CNBC's \"<asset_inline nid=\"102356916\">Trading Nation</asset_inline>.\"<br /> <br />• Schlossberg added that as far as brick-and-mortar retailers go, <asset_inline nid=\"1500014\">Apple</asset_inline> could pose a threat to other retailers' sales given the recent iPhone X launch and its hefty price tag.<br /> <br />• \"If demand for the [iPhone] X really is strong into the Christmas season, it may very well simply cut out spending for all other items,\" he said.<br /> <br />Analysts are expecting earnings per share of 78 cents for Best Buy and 97 cents for Wal-Mart, according to FactSet estimates.<br /> <br /><i> Bottom line: Should Wal-Mart and Best Buy report dim holiday season forecasts on Thursday, this could spell a warning for the retail space, Schlossberg said.</i></p></div></group></body>",

What about you? The position is going in your favor, which means all of your analysis has paid off. Profitable positions \"feel good,\" and we often like to let those positions ride.</p><p>But, when it comes to profitable short options positions, I always consider closing out risk. I try to keep it simple and keep the \"feel good\" (and greed) out of it. When a short options position has gone in my favor and is priced at or below $.05 per contract, I consider closing it. <strong>And since Schwab clients pay no commissions to close short options priced at or below $.05 per contract</strong>, there is very little disincentive.</p><p>For investors who utilize short options strategies (like <asset_inline ext_link=\"http://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/active_trader/trading_insights/options/managing_risk_with_covered_calls_and_covered_puts.html\" ext_title=\"\"> covered calls</asset_inline>, short puts, and spreads), here are some questions to consider when a position has reached close-to-maximum profit:</p><ul>\n<li><strong>How much time is left before the option expires?</strong> If there are more than a few days left before the option expires and the short option has lost the majority of its value, consider closing it. In most cases, the risk of holding the position probably isn't worth the remaining reward.</li>\n</ul><p><strong></strong></p><ol></ol><ul></ul><p>For example, if you sold covered calls for $1 per contract with 40 days until expiration, and those contracts are now priced at $.05 with six days until expiration, consider closing out those contracts. The maximum potential gain left is only $.05 per contract, and a lot can happen (buy-out, analysts upgrade, etc.) in the six remaining days. Closing out the options position gives you (theoretically) unlimited upside potential on the long stock position. Remember, you don't pay a commission to close short options priced at or below $.05, and in this example, the option position has lost 95 percent of its value (from your original entry price).</p><ul>\n<li><strong>What do you think about the underlying position now?</strong> If you hold a short options position that has gone in your favor, and you want to maintain the same bias on that position, consider rolling out to a further expiration.</li>\n</ul><p>For example, let's say you sold puts for $1.20 per contract with a $50 strike price and 38 days until expiration. The stock is now trading at $58 and the options are trading at $.05 with eight days until expiration. If you still have a long bias for that underlying position, consider rolling the short put position \"up and out\" to a higher strike and a later month (like a $55 strike price and 40 days until expiration). Note: in this scenario, you will not pay commission on the buy-to-close put contracts; however, you will be charged commission to establish the new position.</p><ul>\n<li><strong>Spread traders - why not remove the risk associated with the short option contracts and hang onto the long option contracts?</strong></li>\n</ul><p>Let's say you sold a bear call (credit) spread for $1.50 per spread, with 30 days until expiration, using the $60/$65 strike prices. The stock went in your favor (down) and now the short strike option ($60) is priced at $.05 per contract. If you simply close out the short position for $.05 per contract and hold onto the long call position, you have removed the risk associated with the short option and you still have unlimited upside gain potential on the remaining long call. Even though at this point the value of your long call is likely very small, you should recognize that you could lose 100 percent of that remaining value should you choose to hold onto it.</p><p><strong>So why are you waiting until expiration when the position has reached close-to-maximum profit?</strong> From a risk point-of-view, I have held onto short options positions priced at or below $.05 per contract only to see them go significantly against me due to a news announcement or event. Why didn't I close out the positions? I really don't have a great answer. Maybe it was greed. Perhaps I was just too lazy. Or, I didn't want to lose that winning \"feeling.\" Who really knows – but I have learned and will try hard not to make the same mistake.</p><p><strong>Schwab clients pay no commissions to close short options priced at or below $.05 per contract</strong>. I encourage you to learn from my past mistakes (and maybe yours), and take inexpensive risk off the table.</p></div></group></body>",

The flattening yield curve is often viewed as a classic tell of slowing economic growth, leaving some market watchers calling the strength of the rally into question.</p><p>But one technical analyst says the perception that a flat yield curve is bad for stocks is nothing more than \"fake news.\"</p><p>\"The 10 minus 2 US Treasury Yield curve has declined to its flattest level since 2007, and while a flatter curve is often viewed as a macroeconomic concern, we've found that equities have actually posted their strongest returns at comparable points over the last 40 years,\" Oppenheimer's Ari Wald wrote in a recent note. \"Directionally higher rates should also be a tailwind for the S&amp;P's bull cycle, in our view.\"</p><p>In an interview Tuesday on CNBC's \"<asset_inline nid=\"102356916\">Trading Nation</asset_inline>,\" Wald said equities have never done better when considering where the level and the direction of the yield curve stands currently.</p><p>\"In fact, how we measure it, the S&amp;P 500 has averaged a 16.5 percent gain over the next 12 months based on the current level and direction going back 40 years of history. So to say that a flat curve is bad for stocks, … it's fake news,\" Wald said.</p><p><img class=\"inlineChart\" src=\"https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/editorialfiles/charts/2017/11/1510770631_spxbarchart.JPG\"></p><p>The thinking goes like this. A dramatically flattening yield curve is seen as a rather ominous sign because it indicates short-dated Treasury yields are rising as long-dated Treasury yields are falling, as has been the case this year. This activity is thought to suggest investors are betting on a slowdown in economic growth, and that inflation will wane. Of further concern is when the yield curve becomes \"inverted,\" or when yields on shorter-dated debt are greater than those on longer-dated debt, which is seen as indicative of an economic recession.</p><p>In a note to clients on Wednesday, Bank of America rates strategists wrote that further tightening from the Federal Reserve along with a flattening yield curve is \"no longer sustainable.\"</p><p>The authors, led by strategist Shyam S. Rajan, said the central bank and the spread between Treasury maturities are on a \"collision course\" as the Fed is all but sure to raise interest rates in December even as inflation remains tepid and the yield curve flattens precipitously.</p><p>Some are concerned about markets getting hit by a narrowing yield curve, particularly as the market rally's reaction to a flattening curve and historically low interest rates is different than other periods of bull runs, said Gina Sanchez, CEO of Chantico Global. Specifically, she pointed to the 1990s.</p><p>\"The reality is that particular time period is only one episode and that episode lasts from '90 until 1999. And that was a very specific time period when you had a tremendous amount of liquidity being unleashed into the market,\"&#160;Sanchez said Tuesday on \"Trading Nation.\"</p><p>\"That liquidity found its way into the internet bubble, and that bubble basically inflated through that time period. So if you look at valuations for the S&amp;P 500 in the beginning of that time period they were fairly low. They ended fairly high right? That's what led to that stock market return. It really had nothing to do with the flattening of the yield curve.\"&#160;</p><p>Treasury yields were broadly lower in Wednesday trading and stocks fell.</p></div></group></body>",

At this level, we want to look to buy, to go long,\" Baruch said.<br /> <br />• Crude oil, which settled lower on Tuesday at $55.70 per barrel, is set to retest $58 and hit $60, he said, particularly as the commodity's futures contract expires early next week.<br /> <br /> <em>Bottom line: As the crude oil options contract is set to expire on Wednesday, prices could see a boost, and Baruch sees oil headed to $60.</em></p></div></group></body>",

But they are also essential to taking profit, which can then be put to work in new positions. In other words, an exit strategy can be the way out of a trade, which may provide you with capital or buying power that you can use to enter your next trade. So whether you're attempting to secure profits or limit losses, an exit strategy can help you determine how and when to close your trades out.</p><p>Many traders use a combination of tools and analysis to help them formulate their exit strategies. By doing this, they are seeking to identify the level at which to liquidate their position, and they are looking to use technology to help them close their trade at or near that level. For instance, a trader may use advanced <asset_inline ext_link=\"http://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/active_trader/trading_insights/research_analyze/filtering_the_market_using_technical_analysis.html\" ext_title=\"\"> technical analysis</asset_inline> solutions to determine their sell target, then employ a stop order, which can trigger a sell when the position hits that level. It's important to remember that there is no guarantee that a stop order will be executed at or near the stop price.</p><p>But to put tools and technology to work, you need an approach or a general philosophy. Some traders are more analytical. Some are practical. Some are risk-takers. So naturally, as there are different kinds of traders, there are different approaches too.

But if recent history is any indication, the cut may not spell doom for GE shares.</p><p>According to S&amp;P Global, the companies with the biggest dividend cuts outside of the financial crisis are <asset_inline nid=\"1511975\">Pfizer</asset_inline> in January 2009, <asset_inline nid=\"1502318\">Abbott Labs</asset_inline> in December 2012, <asset_inline nid=\"3032663\">Kinder Morgan</asset_inline> in December 2015 and <asset_inline nid=\"1504950\">Conoco Phillips</asset_inline> in February 2016.</p><p>One year after cutting those dividends, three of the four companies surged. Shares of Pfizer, Abbott and ConocoPhillips soared 28, 44, and 49 percent respectively, while Kinder Morgan was lower by about 4 percent. This suggests that GE may possibly follow in their footsteps, a relief for the battered name that has fallen 40 percent this year&#160;and tracking for its worst annual performance since 2008.</p><p><img class=\"inlineChart\" src=\"https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/editorialfiles/charts/2017/11/1510673121_dividend_article.PNG\"></p><p>While it's been a tough year for General Electric shareholders, Matt Maley of Miller Tabak says the dividend cut is not the final nail in the coffin for the stock. \"You need a little bit of faith there that the new CEO can turn things around, but you pick away at it over the next couple of years and it may take a while. But I think you look at 10 years from now and you're going to look really good,\" he said Monday on <asset_inline nid=\"102356916\">CNBC's \"Trading Nation.\"</asset_inline> \"Other things will outperform … [but] I think it's going to be a solid one.&#160; GE's not going out of business.\"</p><p>Chad Morganlander, portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors, believes certain fundamentals need to change for GE to be worth buying. Even as the company has transitioned to new CEO in John Flannery, Morganlander believes the water still looks murky for GE, and Monday's investor meeting did nothing to quell any concerns.</p><p>This is especially true, says Morganlander, about the company's three main branches as GE continues to sell off parts of its business. Flannery confirmed that the company was looking to sell its lighting division and would focus on its health, power and aviation branches.</p><p>\"They have to show some consistency on the free cash flow before we would go and buy,\" Morganlander said on \"Trading Nation.\" \"You could see, potentially 36 months out or more, that they actually break up three divisions that they're hoping to consolidate in 2019, but it remains to be seen.\"</p><p>\"This is perhaps an information situation where we need to see additional information to confirm if you should be fully engaged in the company,\" he added. \"At this point, we would hold, and we'd be underweight if we did on it.\"</p><p>GE stock price was&#160;down 5 percent Tuesday.</p></div></group></body>",

A further decline could begin spilling over and impacting domestic markets, said Matt Maley, equity strategist with Miller Tabak. Here's why:<br /> <br />• The index, aside from its overbought condition, has also seen a large run-up in the last two months, Maley said Monday. To put its move into perspective, the Nikkei's 21 percent gain logged from early September until last week's intraday highs was half of its post-U.S. election rally, and 95 percent of its year-to-date gains, Maley said. This leads him to believe the index is quite extended in the short term.<br /> <br />• Furthermore, a key Daily Sentiment Index reading measuring bullishness on commodity traders saw a strong 93 percent last week, Maley wrote. \"That means there are a lot of people on the bullish side of the boat. When there are THAT many bulls, it frequently signals a near-term top (because there is nobody left to 'buy'),\" he wrote.<br /> <br />• Some cracks appearing in the Russell 2000 small-cap index and the high-yield market are <asset_inline nid=\"104830089\">already flashing warning signs</asset_inline> for U.S. markets, and a more dramatic pullback in foreign markets like the Nikkei and the German DAX could add headwinds for U.S. stocks.</p><p><em><strong>S&amp;P 500 vs. Nikkei 225, 1-year comparison</strong></em></p><p><img class=\"inlineChart\" src=\"https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/editorialfiles/charts/2017/11/1510612425_spxnikkei.JPG\"></p><p>• Finally, crude oil has seen a bounce over the last few months, and higher oil prices tend to be bearish for the Nikkei as Japan imports the vast majority of its crude. The continued upside for crude oil could create a headwind for the Japanese market and the underlying economy.<br /> <br /><i> Bottom line: Maley says that if the Japanese Nikkei weakens further, it could begin hurting U.S. stocks.</i></p></div></group></body>",

Despite some strong U.S. economic data and a much more hawkish central bank stance relative to other G-7 nations, the dollar has been surprisingly weak. Over the last month, the U.S. dollar/Japanese yen relationship has failed to break out above its key 115 level on multiple occasions and now finds itself mired around the 113 mark as markets appear to be at a loss for direction.</p><p>To add insult to injury, many of the key correlations between U.S. dollar/Japanese yen and various markets,&#160;such as the bond market and the <asset_inline nid=\"3032897\">Japanese Nikkei 225</asset_inline>, are beginning to break down; the pair is not nearly as responsive to the rise in U.S. Treasury yields or to the gains in the Nikkei.</p><p>So, what's going on? The answer may lie in Washington, rather than Wall Street.</p><p>High hopes for tax reform have faded, and markets now appear resigned to the fact that legislation will be modest or nonexistent, failing to provide the boost to the U.S. economy that greenback bulls were seeking.</p><p>Little wonder, then, that although the market anticipates a 100 percent chance of a rate hike in December, the yield curve out to 2018 suggests a much more muted expectation for future interest rate hikes.</p><p>Looking ahead, if the tax reform process fails, as health care did, erosion of investor sentiment could trigger a sharp sell-off in equity markets, which have been grossly overbought for months. Any correction in equities could send the U.S. dollar/yen relationship lower on risk aversion flows.</p><p>And although U.S. dollar/Japanese yen is up slightly today as it is finally responding to higher Treasury yields, the breakdown in correlations is troubling, and typically suggests that market sentiment is beginning to change.</p><p>For now, the 113 level in the U.S. dollar/Japanese yen looks vulnerable to a test, especially if U.S. equities see some profit-taking at the start of the week. If it breaks support at that level, we may be witnessing the start of a deeper sell-off in the dollar.</p></div></group></body>",

Thanks to the \"gross margin risk, I wouldn't be buying Wal-Mart, I'd be a seller here,\" he said.</p><p>Wal-Mart reports earnings Thursday morning.

The company will look to exit operations unrelated to those three units, the report said.</p><p>The company's investor day gets underway at 9am ET.</p><p>In a recent note from Cowen, analyst Gautam Khanna wrote that a sum-of-the-parts analysis of&#160;GE suggests its breakup valuation is in the range of $11 to $15 per share, implying between 27 and 46 percent downside to the stock's current value even after this potential restructuring.<br /> <br /> Khanna argues that investors are failing to consider some of the debt-like liabilities that would need to be ascribed to those individual units, if a breakup were to occur.<br /> <br /> \"A major difference in our analysis vs. GE bulls who argue for [sum of the parts] upside is that we penalize GE's enterprise value for debt-like items (underfunded pension; GE Capital's net debt) that would be ascribed to assets if sold,\" wrote Khanna.<br /> <br /> Shares of GE have tumbled 35 percent this year, shedding over $416 billion in market value since topping out in August 2000.<br /> <br /> \"There is no quick fix for GE and the stock remains biased to the downside,\" Khanna added.<br /> <br /> The company's investor day is likely to be a market-moving event, according to Stacey Gilbert, head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna, who said Friday on CNBC's \"<asset_inline nid=\"102356916\">Trading Nation</asset_inline>\" that the options market is implying a dividend cut ahead.<br /> <br /> Other investors have pointed to the company's considerable dividend as reason to own the stock. GE's dividend yield was 4.69 percent, compared with the S&amp;P 500's dividend yield of 1.94 percent. Now that's been cut in half.<br /> <br /> While there are many reasons shareholders should expect to get \"excess yield\" from holding GE, Gilbert said, \"it's a really difficult company to own and justify, particularly as it continues to go down.\"<br /> <br />Prices for puts and calls for GE shares implied a dividend cut between 30 and 50 percent, according to Gilbert so Monday's move should come as no surprise.</p><p>The options market is implying 5 percent move in either direction for the stock on the back of the investor day Monday.</p><p>That's a substantial implied move for its investor day, she said, \"so this really is a big deal. The world is watching, trying to figure out exactly what's going to happen with GE.\"<br /> <br /> In late October, new CEO John Flannery declined to say whether the company would cut its dividend.<br /> <br /> \"From a philosophy perspective, we manage for total shareholder return. So it's going to be a mix of capital that goes into a dividend, and a mix that goes into organic and inorganic investment, and that has to be balanced,\" Flannery <asset_inline nid=\"104786118\">told CNBC's David Faber</asset_inline>.<br /> <br /> Investors will get their answer on Monday.<br /> <br /><i> Disclosure: Stacey Gilbert personally owns shares of General Electric.</i></p></div></group></body>",
